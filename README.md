# AndroidApp

I had to build a little android app using java (it sucks ,i know ...)!

## What does it do ?

1. Select or take a photo!
2. Give it a name!
3. Save it!
4. Reload the app and it will appear on the list!
5. Select one item of the list and you will be able to see the picture in a bigger resolution.
6. That's it! :/
